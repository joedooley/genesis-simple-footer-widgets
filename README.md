== Description ==

This plugin allows you to create multiple footer widgets from a dropdown menu within Genesis Theme Settings. Plugin based on code from Genesis Developer, http://genesisdeveloper.me/controlling-footer-widget-columns-from-theme-settings-page-in-genesis/ .

Creating footer widgets can be a nuisance from project to project. Sometimes the original design calls for 4 footer widgets and by default Genesis only has the proper code for 3 footer widgets.

Genesis Simple Footer Widgets allows you to easily go from no footer widgets to 6 footer widgets without having to worry about adding additional CSS or registering new widget areas.
